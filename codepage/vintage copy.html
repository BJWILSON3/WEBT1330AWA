            <h2>Checking the value of the cards that you have, find, or purchase.</h2>
            <p>
            Growing up there was one major price guide that many people would use to find the value of their cards. The one that always comes to mind and that is Beckett. Not everyone is a collector and to them a card is just a piece of paper with no value. One major problem that vintage cards faced was that young kids would place the cards in the spokes of their bicycle to listen to sound it would make going down the road. This ruend several old cards and adults today are sad when they find out now what they are worth.
