            <h2>Collecting 50 year old cards from past to present</h2>
            <p>
                There are several ways to collect baseball cards.  Starting out by asking friends and family if they have any baseball cards that you can have that mybe they just have stuck away in boxes in the garage from multiple moves and they don't want them anymore. If that doesn't work you can always look online or visit shops around town to see what is available.  There is a chance that you could get lucky going to different garage sales in the area depending on the time of year when they around every corner.

                Not only can you collect baseball cards, but they also have Basketball, Football, and hockey to name a few that you can collect.  At one time they used to have Harley Davidson cards and popular movies showing different scenes from the movie.
            
                This hobby has divided cards into three main segments to help quickly identify the rarity of each card.
